#Moonlight Embedded

This branch has changes allowing the code to be compiled on Raspbian Wheezy.

Moonlight is an open source implementation of NVIDIA's GameStream, as used by the NVIDIA Shield,
but built for Linux/OSX/Windows.

Moonlight Embedded allows you to stream your full collection of Steam games from
your powerful Windows desktop to your embedded system, like Raspberry Pi, CuBox-i and Hummingboard.

For a demo see this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRW6O0bSHNw).

[Moonlight-common-c](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-common-c) is the shared codebase between
different C implementations of Moonlight

[Moonlight](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-android) also has an Android
implementation.

[Moonlight-pc](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-pc) also has an Linux/OSX/Windows
implementation.

[Moonlight iOS](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-ios) also has an iOS
implementation.

[Moonlight Windows](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-windows) also has an Windows and Windows Phone
implementation.

##Features

* Streams Steam and all of your games from your PC to your embedded system.

##Installation

* Download [GeForce Experience](http://www.geforce.com/geforce-experience) and install on your Windows PC
* Download the compiled version from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/irtimmer/moonlight-embedded/releases)
* Install libopus0 (Debian/Raspbian) or opus (Arch Linux/Fedora/Pidora)
* [Configure sound](http://elinux.org/R-Pi_Troubleshooting#Sound)

##Requirements

* [GFE compatible](http://shield.nvidia.com/play-pc-games/) computer with GTX 600/700/900 series GPU (for the PC you're streaming from)
* High-end wireless router (802.11n dual-band recommended) or wired network
* Geforce Experience 2.1.1 or higher

##Quick Start

* Ensure your machine and embedded system are on the same network
* Turn on Shield Streaming in the GFE settings
* Start Moonlight Embedded with pair
* Accept the pairing confirmation on your PC
* Start Moonlight Embedded with stream
* Play games!

##Usage
	Usage: moonlight [options] host

	Actions:

	pair Pair device with computer
	stream Stream computer to device
	list List available games and applications
	quit Quit the application or game being streamed
	help Show this help

	Streaming options:

	-720 Use 1280x720 resolution (default)
	-1080 Use 1920x1080 resolution
	-width <width> Horizontal resolution (default 1280)
	-height <height> Vertical resolution (default 720)
	-30fps Use 30fps
	-60fps Use 60fps (default)
	-bitrate <bitrate> Specify the bitrate in Kbps
	-packetsize <size> Specify the maximum packetsize in bytes
	-app <app> Name of app to stream

	Use ctrl-c to exit application

##Compile (these instructions for compiling on Raspbian and are slightly different from upstream)

* Install dependencies ```sudo apt-get install cmake libopus-dev libexpat1-dev libjs-jquery libssl-dev libasound2-dev libudev-dev libavahi-client-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev```
* Raspbian Wheezy (Stable) doesn't ship with libevdev which is a requirement. Download and install the libevdev packages from the Raspbian "Jessie" repos:
```
wget http://archive.raspbian.org/raspbian/pool/main/libe/libevdev/libevdev-dev_1.4.2%2bdfsg-1_armhf.deb
wget http://archive.raspbian.org/raspbian/pool/main/libe/libevdev/libevdev-tools_1.4.2%2bdfsg-1_armhf.deb
wget http://archive.raspbian.org/raspbian/pool/main/libe/libevdev/libevdev2_1.4.2%2bdfsg-1_armhf.deb
sudo dpkg -i libevdev*
```
* Initialize the git submodules ``git submodule update --init``

```
mkdir build
cd build/
cmake ../
make
```
